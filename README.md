### Hiya, I'm Walter! ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find some of the projects I've been working on. 

I want to make everything as permissive as I possibly can, mostly licensed under The Unlicense (Public Domain). <br>
I still have much cleaning up to do for full releases, it's best for everyone when everything is benchmarked and tested, but that takes time.  <br>
If you're interested in any of the projects, and would prefer me to work on specific one(s) - feel free to [Ask me](https://github.com/Walter-Hulsebos/Walter-Hulsebos/discussions)!

<details>
  <summary>Package usage info</summary>

  If you're using code of mine, please give it a little **Star** ðŸŒŸ on GitHub, it'll show me it's being used.
  <br> 
  User count is among the most important factors for deciding what projects I'll work on.
